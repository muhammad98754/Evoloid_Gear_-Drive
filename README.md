# Evoloid_Gear_-Drive (LUA language) --3D printing
3D Printing with IceSL Slicer and Modeler Using LUA Programming
 
 
 
Project: High Gear Ratio Evoloid Gear Drive Development

•Designed and created a high gear ratio Evoloid gear drive using IceSL modeler and slicer and LUA scripting language, utilizing 3D printing to achieve precise and accurate results.


•Produced a final gear assembly by generating an STL file using IceSL slicer and printing it using FDM 3D printing technology, demonstrating proficiency in designing and manufacturing complex mechanical systems


The coding for this project was written in LUA programming language, and I utilized ICeSL Modeler and Slicer for the implementation. I was able to generate an STL file using ICeSL Slicer, which could be later used as a G-code provider for FDM printers. Finally, the assembled gear was successfully printed at the designated site.
